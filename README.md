*DESCRIPTION*

This entire project was made to made to show the various skills I've learned throughout my Web Developement course in college. Throughout the many sections, I've adapted various element features to structure the webpage. Currently, the sections are currently split into eight seperate sections:

1. Navigation

In this section I learned how to impliment a navigation system to traverse my webpage a lot more easily. I implimented buttons that can be used on wider screens, while also implimenting a hamburger menu for mobile screen sizes. Wthin this area, I also learned how to style and create a webpage title and logo.

2. Hero

In this section I learned how to create a hero section by learning to how structure and style a heading with a leading picture. 

3. Bio

Within this section, I learned how to create and style paragraphs seperately within HTML and CSS. I also learned how to create and style a hyperlink which leads to a video outside of my webpage. This is the first section where I learned how to use the :link, :visited, :hover, and :active selectors specfically to change the color state of the link based on the cursor interactions with the link.

4. Hobbies

Within this section, I learned how to create and style an unordered list element. I created a list title, the list items, and paragraphs that elaborated on the mentioned items. I adapted how to use the :first-child pdseudo-class to style the first letter of all of the list item texts. I also learned how to use text shadows to highlight and define the title text and the list item texts.

5. Image Gallery

In this section I learned how to upload pictures and style both the structure and the elements of my pictures. I also learned how to apply media queries to adjust the structure of my gallery so that it can be practical and responsive for different screen sizes. This is also another place where I used the :hover selector to style my gallery pictures so they could have an effect when a cursor hovers over the picture in larger screen sizes.

6. Blog



7. Media Video

In this section I learned how to embed a video which I created outside of my webpage. I also learend how to style it and make it responsive and stable through CSS commands and media queries.

8. Contact Form

Last but not least, in this final section I learned how to create and style a working contact form with HTML and CSS. I learned the various mechanics of submissions and interactions that can be used to receive and collect information from potential users of my webapge.

*COLOR SCHEME*

Generally speaking I am fond of "dark mode" color schemes where text is highlighted to darker backgrounds. I am also fond of cool colors to match the darker aspect. In this project, I used darker colors to style my webpage so that it is easier to read in darker environments.

The main colors used are:

#000000
#000C35
#002E59
#EDEDED
