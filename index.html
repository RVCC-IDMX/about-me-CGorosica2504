            <h2> My Hobbies and Interests</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Video Games</li>

                <p>Out of all of the things I do, I'd say that playing video games is my most favorite thing to do. Specifically, I love to play RPGs, adventure, survival, and
                    sandbox games. I find that playing video games is the best way for me to enjoy my personal time. As so, I do it almost always whenever I have time
                    to kill or when I want to relax.
                </p>

                <p>At the current moment, my favorite video game is this 2D survival adventure game called Terraria. I have the most hours played on it out of all of the games I own, and 
                    despite having played it for so long, I have yet to get tired of starting this game up and playing a new world each time. Especially since I tend to play with mods
                    that add even more content.
                </p>

                <li>Reading</li>

                <p>Often times if I'm not playing video games, I tend to read books instead. Whether it be my physical books that I have, or an online story, I find that reading is
                    another peaceful and enjoyable way to spend my time. While I do play video games a lot more, I can not deny that a good book is just as good to me at times.
                </p>

                <p>So far my favorite book series has to be The Witcher series by Andrzej Sapkowski. Originally I found the Witcher story through the third game adaption, The Witcher
                    3: Wild Hunt. After playing the game, I was thoroughly impressed with the story and the characters as it became part of my Top 3 favorite games of all time. Given
                    that fascination, I went on to the books as I was hungry to know more of the game's story, and now, this book series is my top favorite of all time.
                </p>

                <li>Birds</li>

                <p>For some reason, at some point in time, I grew a tiny bit of interest in birds. Perhaps it was the fact that I grew up with one when I was younger, but nowadays
                    I find that birds are pretty cool animals. Now, while I do find them interesting, I don't tend to have a thorough desire to learn about them. However, thanks to
                    my parents, I do have three pet birds. They're all Budgerigars.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One is named Chefesita. She's a regular ole Australian budgie, meaning that she's the regular predominantly green budgie with a yellow forehead. Out of my
                    three birds, she has the most to say and the biggest attitude. She truly believes that what she says, goes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My second is one named Chefesito. He's a slightly different coloration where he is predominantly yellow and then green. He's the goodest boy but also a shy boy. Out 
                    of the three, he loves to talk and sing the most. He has the strongest chirp in the house and can talk to you all day about his thorough desire of seeds and my
                    finger, assuming he's warmed up to you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Last but definitely not least, I have Ivy, an almost white but yellowish budgie with red eyes. She's a crazy little girl who is not afraid to make noise and cause chaos. While
                    she's more reserved than Chefesita, Ivy is not afraid to cause a ruckus herself. She loves to hang upside down and swing on her swing, loves to fly fast, and has 
                    a fascination with hiding from me by blending in with the walls of my room. She's the best at hiding and she won't give a break sometimes because of that.
                </p>

                <li>Music</li>
                <p>
                    On the lower level of my Top 5 interests/hobbies, I'd say music takes fourth. While nowhere near as much of an activity for me as playing video games and reading,
                    I do occasionally like to listen to music by itself or when I'm doing something.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I seem to have a more direct interest in instrumentals than lyrics. As so, I seem to really enjoy listening to soundtracks and standalone compositions. I have a 
                    playlist in YouTube full of various standalone tracks and media soundtracks. Apart from that, I also seem to enjoy listening to EDM, primarily Progressive House,
                    Trap, and Chillstep, often preferring that the music has little to no vocals. Last but not least, since I find that metal guitars sound pretty cool, I also enjoy
                    listening to Metal Core and Future Rock. I find that Metal tends to give me a lot of energy when the instrumentals are cool and that Future Rock is a nice genre
                    to have play in the background.
                </p>

                <li>Food</li>

                <p>I know, I know. To say that food is an interest or a hobby is cheesy, but to be honest, I like food. A lot. What? Don't judge me, you know you like food too.</p>

                <p>As far as my tastes go, I really like eating spicy foods and sweets. As for my favorite food, it is rice. Do NOT let me near rice. I promise you with no doubt that
                    if you leave me with cooked rice in the vicinity, I WILL consume every single grain. I love rice.
                </p>

                <p>Stop judging me.</p>
