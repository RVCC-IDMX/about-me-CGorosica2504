            <h2> My Hobbies and Interests</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Video Games</li>

                <p>Out of all of the things I do, I'd say that playing video games is my most favorite thing to do. Specifically, I love to play RPGs, adventure, survival, and
                    sandbox games. I play video games almost always whenever I have time to kill or when I want to relax. At the current moment, my favorite video game is this 2D survival adventure game called Terraria. I have the most hours played on it out of all of the games I own.
                </p>

                <li>Reading</li>

                <p>Often times if I'm not playing video games, I tend to read books instead. Whether it be my physical books that I have, or an online story, I find that reading is
                    another peaceful and enjoyable way to spend my time. While I do play video games a lot more, I can not deny that a good book is just as good to me at times. So far my favorite book series has to be The Witcher series by Andrzej Sapkowski.
                </p>

                <li>Birds</li>

                <p>For some reason, at some point in time, I grew a tiny bit of interest in birds. Perhaps it was the fact that I grew up with one when I was younger, but nowadays
                    I find that birds are pretty cool animals. Now, while I do find them interesting, I don't tend to have a thorough desire to learn about them. However, thanks to
                    my parents, I do have two pet birds. They're all Budgerigars.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One is named Chefesita. She's a regular ole Australian budgie, meaning that she's the regular predominantly green budgie with a yellow forehead. Out of my
                    three birds, she has the most to say and the biggest attitude. She truly believes that what she says, goes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My second one is called Ivy, an almost white but yellowish budgie with red eyes. She's a crazy little girl who is not afraid to make noise and cause chaos. While
                    she's more reserved than Chefesita, Ivy is not afraid to cause a ruckus herself. She loves to hang upside down and swing on her swing, loves to fly fast, and has 
                    a fascination with hiding from me by blending in with the walls of my room.
                </p>

                <li>Music</li>
                <p>
                    On the lower level of my Top 5 interests/hobbies, I'd say music takes fourth. While nowhere near as much of an activity for me as playing video games and reading,
                    I do occasionally like to listen to music by itself or when I'm doing something.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I seem to have a more direct interest in instrumentals than lyrics. As so, I seem to really enjoy listening to soundtracks and standalone compositions. I have a 
                    playlist in YouTube full of various standalone tracks and media soundtracks. Apart from that, I also seem to enjoy listening to EDM, primarily Progressive House,
                    Trap, and Chillstep, often preferring that the music has little to no vocals. Last but not least, since I find that metal guitars sound pretty cool, I also enjoy
                    listening to Metal Core and Future Rock. I find that Metal tends to give me a lot of energy when the instrumentals are cool and that Future Rock is a nice genre
                    to have play in the background.
                </p>

                <li>Food</li>

                <p>I know, I know. To say that food is an interest or a hobby is cheesy, but to be honest, I like food. A lot. What? Don't judge me, you know you like food too.</p>

                <p>As far as my tastes go, I really like eating spicy foods and sweets. As for my favorite food, it is rice. Do NOT let me near rice. I promise you with no doubt that
                    if you leave me with cooked rice in the vicinity, I WILL consume every single grain. I love rice.
                </p>

                <p>Stop judging me.</p>

            <h2>CSS Image Hover Effect</h2>

            <div>

                <p>
                    Through the use of the selector ":hover" one can apply a hover effect on an image element when a user hovers their mouse cursor over it. Along with the :hover selector, within the selection one needs to apply a "transition:" declaration to designate the property being affected, the length of time for the effect, the speed form of the effect, and if desired, the amount of time an effect is delayed before activating when the cursor begins to hover over the element.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As noted in the image below, for Figure 1, there has been a hover effect added for the image to lose opacity when a user hovers over it using the "opacity:()" property. Note the length of the effect,  the speed of how the effect takes place, and the dramatic delay that was implemented.
                </p>

                    </figure>

                <p>
                    When it comes to images, there are various effects one can apply to the image apart from their opacity. For example, through the use of the "transform" function, you can assign the "translate()" property so that one can designate the image to move a certain distance on the x-axis and/or y-axis when a cursor is over the image as noted below in Figure 2.
                </p>

                    </figure>


                <p>
                    Through the use of the "scale()" property under the transform function, one can code an effect where the image scales in either the x-direction or the y-direction. Essentially, the scale property can "enlarge" or "shrink" an image. It can even flip a picture if the values are made negative. Below is Figure 3 which showcases an example figure that shrinks slowly when a user hovers over it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Below is Figure 4, showcasing how the opposite happens, the image enlarges quickly instead as instructed.
                </p>

                <!-- Scale Enlarge Effect -->

                    <figure class="blog-picture-set">

                <p>
                    Apart from affecting the location and sizes of an image upon hovering, you can also add filter effects through the use of the "filter:()" to an image. For the filter property, there are different effects you can assign. For example, you can apply a grayscale percentage through the use of the "grayscale()" property, removing a certain amount of coloration from an image upon a hover.
                </p>

                <!-- Grayscale Filter Figure -->

                    <figure class="blog-picture-set">

                        <div class="grayscale-fig">

                            <img src="img\chefesita-hover.png" alt="Sample picture of chefesita">

                        </div>

                    </figure>

                <p>
                    Similarly, you can also apply a sepia filter by a percentage by using the "sepia()" property, changing the image's colors into a retro fashion yellow-brown and black coloration.
                </p>

                <!-- Sepia Filter Figure -->

                    <figure class="blog-picture-set">

                        <div class="sepia-fig">

                    </figure>

                <p>
                    Another effect is to increase the saturation by a percentage using the "saturate()" property, strengthening the colors of an image. This can be used for emphasis on an image. 
                </p>

                <!-- Saturation Filter Figure -->

                    <figure class="blog-picture-set">

                        <div class="saturation-fig">

                            <img src="img\chefesita-hover.png" alt="Sample picture of chefesita">

                    </figure>

                <p>
                    For those who seek a drastic effect, one can apply the "invert()" property to completely inverse the colors of an image to their opposites. Or, perhaps for the creative, you can apply this filter to "correct" an image back to normal colors upon the hover.
                </p>

                <!-- Invert Colors Filter Figure -->

                    <figure class="blog-picture-set">

                        <div class="invert-fig">

                            <img src="img\chefesita-hover.png" alt="Sample picture of chefesita">

                    </figure>

                <p>
                    Naturally, apart from setting only one effect to take place, you can set multiple. To do this, make you sure are placing a comma between the sections of variables for each effect you are attempting to apply if you only wish to have specific effects to take place, otherwise, you can simply use the transition property without designating a particular effect. Note below how I've applied three different effects to occur when you hover over the image of the CSS.

                    Using image hover effects can be quite fun, but one must use them sparingly as too many effects on an image can reduce the performance of a website on a user's computer. That being said, there is no shortage of creativity that one can show with their CSS code on an image hover.
